      "<p>The Rev. Dr. Timothy C. Ahrens has led First Congregational Church, United Church of Christ in downtown Columbus through a season of tremendous growth. Under his leadership, First Church has doubled in membership during an era when seven downtown churches have closed their doors.

His comments and columns have been widely published, from the Wall Street Journal and New York TImes to the Columbus Dispatch and over 40 other Ohio newspapers. He has built relationships with other pastors, lay people and city leaders to work to end poverty through improved education, fair labor laws, job creation, fair housing, health care reform and equal rights for all people. He has advocated for the end of gun violence and the abolition of the death penalty and has served two terms as co-president of B.R.E.A.D. (Building Responsibility Equality And Dignity), which he helped found in 1996. To move compassion for the poor forward across Ohio, Rev. Ahrens launched We Believe Ohio in 2006.</p><p>Rev.
